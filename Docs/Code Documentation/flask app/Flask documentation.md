# Flask - System for pratical evaluation of network administration 

Inside the folder containing the python code for the flask app you will find various folders.

export PYTHONPATH=$PWD, use this in folder above main.py

```inventory```:
This folder contains various files pertinent to the functionality of the evaluation module __nornir_lib__ see its documentation for more details.  

```application```:
This folder contains the various [flask blueprints](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/tutorial/views/) that contain the various different parts of the app.  
These blueprints are:  
    
- ```auth```
Contains the pages and functions related to authentication

- ```exercise```
Contains the pages and functions related with the exercises

- ```home```:
Contains the initial pages of the app.

- ```profile```:
Contains the various profile pages and functions.

- ```test```:
Contains the methods that interface with nornir_lib to perform tests on the exercices.

- ```vm```:
Contains the methods that interface with proxmox to manage the work environments.

- ```__init__.py```
Registers all the above mentioned blueprints, in accordance to flasks blueprints methodology

- ```models.py```
Contains the SQLAlchemy implementation of the database modelled [here](../../Requirements/flask_db.drawio.png)



In the root of this folder you will find __wsgi.py__ which is the entry point for starting the entire flask app.

BEWARE that, in it's current state, the app will add ".." to it's PATH.

This is because of importing the nornir_lib and proxmox folders.

In the root of this folder, you will also find config.yaml which is also required by __nornir_lib__ .

Lastly you will find __config.py__ which is responsible for loading a .env located at the same level which must contain a set of values used in the app like:

- ```PROXMOX_HOST``` - The name or ip address of a ProxmoxVE node #NOTE: at this stage this project only supports working with a single node.
- ```PROXMOX_USER``` - A valid username to login on the specificied node e.g "exampleuser@pvenodename".
- ```PROXMOX_PASSWORD``` - The corresponding password for the given user.
- ```SECRET_KEY``` - Necessary for cryptography reasons. The longer it is, the better and ideally not even you should know its value.
- ```SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI``` - URI pointing to the database

## PLEASE MAKE SURE .env FILE IS NOT UPLOADED ANYWHERE, NOT EVEN STORED IN GIT
