5/11
wireshark caps to understand why commands sometimes dont work 
Research about proxmox firewall, snapshots and containers vs VMs

12/11
changes in proxmox scripts related to VM operations
studied workings of proxmox firewall - https://ciaduck.blogspot.com/2020/04/proxmox-firewall-and-isolating-vms.html?m=1
wrote proxmox script to create firewall rules to isolate VMs
made some tests on snapshot speeds with and without ram

19/11
started work on flask
fixed some errors in firewall api script
restructed project folders
implemented some basic endpoints to interact with proxmox via the flask application
WSGI Research - https://www.fullstackpython.com/wsgi-servers.html
Gunicorn experiments on 'teacher' vm
Study of flask basics - https://hackersandslackers.com/series/build-flask-apps/


26/11
More work on flask (more restructuring, blueprints, etc.)
Integrated proxmox api calls with flask application
Working on implementing nornir tasks with flask application

03/12
GNS3 Web - explore (still in beta phase, altough from experimenting it seems feature complete)
Clone before evaluation - explore (cloning active VM is possible, but not with RAM which is what we want, not possible on containers with RAM, not with backups neither snapshots )
Explore use of containers in conjunction with GNS3 Web (possible, just install gns3-server on container)
Make more than 1 user use a single gns3 server (possible, but no user isolation, everything is shared, not desirable in exam setting)
Worked on site front end (just basic html and redirecting to gns3 web directly from site) 
Containers - cant seem to use ubuntu 24.04/10 (needs to update proxmox packages but always gives error) ((FIXED, had to change proxmox repository settings to update packages))

10/12
Write some documentation about flask app, proxmox api calls and nornir usage.

Containers - Setting up a template GNS3 Container (QEMU guest agent cant be run on containers, priviledged or not. is this a problem?
it actually can, by passing the host's /dev/kvm/ to the containers but doing so leaves open a big attack vector...
https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/kvm-inside-lxc-container.54168/
Switching from QEMU to docker within GNS3 seems doable, abandoning linux support in GNS3 doesn't...)

NETMIKO send_command might be the cause for tests sometimes not working "randomly" (fast_cli set to false, after some testing, problem seems taken care of... )

Containers - Contrary to VMs, IP seems to change frequently, solve this or workaround it? (non-issue)


17/12

GNS3 - multiple gns3 web server instances running on a single VM?(no, all instances can still access each other's files)

Docker in GNS3(still limited, alternative would be running any QEMU VM directly on proxmoxVE, good suggestion for future work)

Created a template GNS3-Server, provisioned with a working templates for a cisco router, switch, linux machine and VPCS, base on ubuntu 24.10
Did not use GNS3-VM due to it not being any easier to setup than our GNS3-Server.

Create a exercise ( problem definition (html markdown), tests to run (allow multiple (allow granular grading over a sets of steps)) ,with ability to import from file(csv for example), include gns3 topology with ability to insert pre configurations to be made after import)


2/01
(ongoing) create a exercise ( problem definition (html markdown), tests to run (allow multiple (allow granular grading over a sets of steps)) ,with ability to import from file(csv for example), include gns3 topology with ability to insert pre configurations to be made after import)
- added a database to the flask application
- worked on creating a vm for a student when required(not finished)
- refined database uml definition
- added login and signup capabilites(currently disabled for ease of development)

8/01:

VM creation
- fixed a few errors in database implementation
- wrote code to clone template vm into work vm using event listeners (after_insert)
- rewrote code to not use event listeners, now fires manually, as event listeners were causing some sequences, and were perhaps overkill

implemented proxmox authentication token storage, reducing # of calls to API

small documentation work

14/01:
(ongoing) create a exercise ( problem definition (html markdown), tests to run (allow multiple (allow granular grading over a sets of steps)) ,with ability to import from file(csv for example), include gns3 topology with ability to insert pre configurations to be made after import)
- Focus on exercise definition form
- Client side form (separation of concerns)

Thin provisioning research
WSGI research
cleaned up some code related to proxmox API interaction
some Un-hardcoding of ping test
added some input capabilites to ping and traceroute test
Re-implemented changes to template gns3-server VM, specifically telnet backdoor to linuxvm
need gns3-webclient-pack to be able to connect to spice console of linuxvm
reenable login capabilites
made the "connect to work environment", "start" and "stop" buttons interact with the correct vm, given a user and exercise

Readded telnet backdoor to linuxvm (work by previous student)
discuss this (was necessary for some reason, now isn't?)
SPICE needed for gui, need to add a telnet backdoor, or a better way
For SPICE connection by way of gns3-web, machine connecting to gns3 remotely must have gns3-webclient-pack installed locally
Insert code changes in 
/usr/share/gns3/gns3-server/lib/python3.12/site-packages/gns3server/compute/qemu/qemu_vm.py
and 
/usr/share/gns3/gns3-server/lib/python3.12/site-packages/gns3server/compute/base_node.py

switch doesnt have ttl option...? check if its because IOS version?
Switch has Cisco IOS V15.2 , no ttl option
Router has Cisco IOS V12.4 , has ttl option

tried cloning 20 vms based on vm 110, only managed 4 clones before proxmox threw an error:
 " Error: 500 Server Error: got no worker upid - start worker failed for url: https://localhost:8006/api2/json/nodes/pve1/qemu/110/clone "
Find a way to increase number of workers, but even that wont help for much
Listen for the error, stop and continue when one or more jobs are completed
... cant seem to replicate the error...

21/01:
figure out configuration of template VM (base gns3-vm -> provision with gns3-topology -> run provided commands -> convert into template -> clone for use)

automated the following steps:
- Create new vm from base gns3-server vm
- import gns3 project into new vm
- transform new vm into a template
- record new template data into db
- create the necessary work vms with the new template vm as base

in a first iteration, sleep() was used to give some time to proxmox/gns3 between steps
aftewards checks were implemented using proxmox and gns3 API, this not only makes sure that we can proceed forward but also makes for less time idling uncessarily
however, the checks done using the gns3 api are not reliable, for example when checking if project is imported sucessfully it will claim yes, even if its still ongoing

04/02:

generated unique hostnames for each vm
implement nornir commands in form
started writing

convert proxmox_api and gns3_api into nornir
- in the case of gns3_api there isnt much gain in converting to nornir, as the main benefit would be paralelization and calls to gns3 are sequential in nature.
- in the case of proxmox_api at first glance there would be benefit in paralelizing vm cloning

11/02:
work on generic module - flask app now can sucessfully use module for multiple hosts with multiple commands
added logging and cleaned code of gns3_api and proxmox_api
make a delete exercise function that deletes an exercise and all related work vms and template vm
test vm cloning with different vm quantities and measure time 


18/02:
exercise create get hostnames from gns3project file
make vm cloning non sequential and paralelizable -celery

25/02:
io problems? disks were not being properly removed and eventually filesystem started becoming clogged
YEP, now vm cloning with celery seems to be much faster 
make vm cloning non sequential and paralelizable -celery proxmox got no worker upid (also explain other approaches and why i chose the one i did)
gunicorn workers test with varying types

05/03:
finish celery

11/03:
document the need to delete files in archive of pve and how disk removal sometimes fails silently
vg files politic
disks try to replicate and eventually report and research
httpx async isolated test
integrate httpx into flask, removing celery

18/03:
Quart migration ? quart migration by itself is easy, quart-extensions (quart-sqlalchemy, quart-auth) are a PITA
fast-api evaluation?

25/03:
disregard quart, migrate to fastapi

01/04:
final fastapi migration work
writing

08/04:
make table of contents for dissertation 
LDAP proxmox and fastapi
request validation button in interface and functionality in code

inlist student in exercise and create vm 
delist student and delete vm

15/04:
more LDAP, create users with or without privileges
code clean up for gns3 and proxmox api interactions
implement retrying logic
verify exercises student is inlisted in
