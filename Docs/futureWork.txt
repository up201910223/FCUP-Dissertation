Containers instead of full QEMU VMs (this is trivial if you dont require the use of emulated linux machines in your gns3-server instances)

Switch to GNS3VM deplyoment instead of doing our manual setup which isnt much more than Ubuntu + gns3-server (Althought there doesnt seem to be much to benefit from this, apart from a bit of standartization)

Figure out how to run the GNS3 QEMU VMs (gns3 linux instances) directly on proxmox while having the rest in a container.

Make the project support more than 1 ProxmoxVE node, this could help with scalability

Research and implement integration with existing LDAP/Active directory instances (replacing the 'user' table)

mark exercises or even students as active/inactive? (to reduce number of existing VMs, as storage may be cheap but not infinite)

add HTTPS capabilites

optimize DB usage, (exercise creation and deletion), look into making async db operations
